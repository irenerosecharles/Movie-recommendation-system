#MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
this is my first ever personal mini project
i used llms like claude and chatgpt

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
i took a dataset from kaggle
had to trim the dataset because it was too big
got a simple code to match the movies using python prgramming
used cosine similarity and vecrotization to find similar movies

finally made an app interface using streamlit cloud
